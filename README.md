## Earthquake Prediction using Hybrid Neural Network

## Overview:
  * Our prototype is intended for predicting major earthquakes all around the world.
 
  * The model is trained on the dataset which has historic data of significant earthquakes that occurred
	  between the years 1965 and 2016.
   * Our model uses Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) for clustering and feature engineering.
	  Then the output from these DNNs are treated as input for a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with LSTM.
   * The output of RNN includes ,but not limited to, [latitude,longitude,magnitude_of_the_earthquake,approximate_date_of occurance].
	
  * We intend to deliver our prototype as a web application
	
* The model can be improved for predicting other natural disasters.
## Technologies:
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Flask
* MySQL
* GitHub
* Microsoft Azure
